Carve your own clever path to vengeance in the critically acclaimed adventure from developer FromSoftware, creators of Bloodborne and the Dark Souls series.','Several years before the events of the first game, Nate and Sam hunt for the treasure of pirate Henry Avery, who plundered a fortune during the 1695 Gunsway heist. Alongside Rafe, the Drake brothers infiltrate a Panamanian jail to access the former cell of Averys first mate, where Nate discovers a hollow St. Dismas idol. When the prison warden who aided them demands a cut, Rafe impulsively kills him, triggering a frantic escape. Nate and Rafe successfully escape, but Sam is shot by guards, presumed dead.

Fifteen years later, following the events of the previous game, Nate has retired with his wife Elena but misses the excitement of his old life. He is visited by Sam, who survived the gunshots and has spent the intervening time incarcerated. He explains that he escaped with drug lord Hector Alcazar, who demands that Sam find Averys treasure or be killed. Nate agrees to help Sam, lying to Elena that he has accepted a salvaging job in Malaysia which he had actually refused. Aided by Sully, the Drakes steal a duplicate Dismas idol from an illegal auction in Italy, bringing them into conflict with South African mercenary boss Nadine Ross and her employer, Rafe, who is still searching for Averys treasure. A map inside the idol leads the Drakes to St. Dismas cathedral in the Scottish Highlands. There, they discover a hidden temple and a map highlighting Kings Bay in Madagascar.',360000,1,1);

Players control Joel, a smuggler tasked with escorting a teenage girl, Ellie, across a post-apocalyptic United States. The Last of Us is played from a third-person perspective. Players use firearms and improvised weapons, and can use stealth to defend against hostile humans and cannibalistic creatures infected by a mutated fungus in the genus Cordyceps. In the online multiplayer mode, up to eight players engage in cooperative and competitive gameplay.','In 2013, an outbreak of a mutant Cordyceps fungus ravages the United States, transforming its human hosts into aggressive creatures known as the Infected. In the suburbs of Austin, Texas, Joel (Troy Baker) flees the chaos with his brother Tommy (Jeffrey Pierce) and daughter Sarah (Hana Hayes). As they flee, Sarah is shot by a soldier and dies in Joels arms.
Twenty years later, civilization has been decimated by the infection. Survivors live in totalitarian quarantine zones, independent settlements, and nomadic groups, leaving buildings and houses deserted. Joel works as a smuggler with his partner Tess (Annie Wersching) in the quarantine zone in the North End of Boston, Massachusetts. They hunt down Robert (Robin Atkin Downes), a black-market dealer, to recover a stolen weapons cache. Before Tess kills him, Robert reveals that he traded the cache with the Fireflies, a rebel militia opposing the quarantine zone authorities.
The leader of the Fireflies, Marlene (Merle Dandridge), promises to double their cache in return for smuggling a teenage girl, Ellie (Ashley Johnson), to Fireflies hiding in the Massachusetts State House outside the quarantine zone. Joel, Tess, and Ellie sneak out in the night, but after an encounter with a government patrol, they discover Ellie is infected. Symptoms normally occur within two days, but Ellie claims she was infected three weeks earlier and that her immunity may lead to a cure. The trio make their way to their destination through hordes of the infected, but find that the Fireflies there have been killed. Tess reveals she has been bitten by an infected and, believing in Ellies importance, sacrifices herself against pursuing soldiers so Joel and Ellie can escape. Joel decides to find Tommy, a former Firefly, in the hope that he can locate the remaining Fireflies.
With the help of Bill (W. Earl Brown), a smuggler and survivalist who owes Joel a favor, they acquire a working vehicle from Bills neighborhood. Driving into Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Joel and Ellie are ambushed by bandits, and their car is wrecked. They ally with two brothers, Henry (Brandon Scott) and Sam (Nadji Jeter). After they escape the city, Sam is bitten but hides it from the group. As his infection takes hold, Sam attacks Ellie, but Henry shoots him dead before taking his own life. In the fall, Joel and Ellie finally find Tommy in Jackson, Wyoming, where he has assembled a fortified settlement near a hydroelectric dam with his wife Maria (Ashley Scott). Joel decides to leave Ellie with Tommy, but after she confronts him about Sarah, he lets her stay with him. Tommy directs them to a Fireflies enclave at the University of Eastern Colorado. They find the university abandoned, but learn that the Fireflies have moved to a hospital in Salt Lake City, Utah. The two are attacked by bandits, and Joel is severely wounded while escaping.',360000,1,2 );

The player progresses through the game by exploring the solar system and learning clues to the cause of the time loop. Outer Wilds received critical acclaim and received several Game of the Year awards, including the British Academy Games Award for Best Game.

Every loop resets when the sun goes supernova after 22 minutes, or when the player-character otherwise dies.

The player learns that the Nomai were obsessed with finding the "Eye of the Universe", a massive anomaly using macroscopic quantum mechanics that is older than the universe itself. Curious to find out what was held within the Eye, but having lost its signal, the Nomai built an orbital cannon to launch probes to visually find the Eye. The chance of visually finding the object with a random shot into space was infinitesimally small, so they also developed a device, the Ash Twin Project, to send the results of the probes scan 22 minutes back in time, so that the cannon could be "reused" an infinite number of times. The amount of power required to go back in time was so high that the only viable way of obtaining it would be from a supernova, so they attempted to artificially induce the sun to explode, but were unsuccessful. The Nomai were wiped out by an extinction-level event after completing construction of these projects but before setting the time-loop process into motion. The system is now operating because the sun has naturally reached the end of its life cycle. The resulting supernova feeds power into the Ash Twin Project, conveying the players memories back in time to their previous self and resetting the cannon for another scan.',360000,2,1  );

The game also features a large number of minigames.[3]','Cody and May, a married couple, are planning on getting a divorce.

At first, Cody and May are more focused on trying to reach Rose, who they hope knows of a way to return them to their human bodies. However, Hakim continually interferes with their progress, often putting obstacles and tests in their way to force them to collaborate to progress. They also come across magically anthropomorphic versions of their old possessions, who criticize Cody and May for their mistreatment and negligence of both their possessions and Rose.

10,000 years later, the kingdom of Hyrule had since regressed to a medieval state.Reading their ancestors prophecies, the Hylians recognized the signs of Ganons return and excavated surrounding areas to uncover the Divine Beasts and Guardians.[25] During this time, Princess Zelda trained vigorously to awaken the sealing magic needed to defeat Ganon while trying to maintain her personal research. In the meantime, a knight was appointed to protect her: Link, who was chosen due to his ability to wield the Master Sword, also known as the Sword that Seals the Darkness. The champions of Hyrules races — Daruk, warrior of the mountainous Goron; Mipha, princess of the aquatic Zora; Revali, archer of the birdlike Rito; and Urbosa, chief of the desert-dwelling Gerudo — assembled to pilot the Divine Beasts (Vah Rudania, Vah Ruta, Vah Medoh, and Vah Naboris, respectively) while the current Zelda and Link battled Ganon.[26] However, Ganon possessed the Guardians and Divine Beasts, turning them against Hyrule. King Rhoam and the Champions were killed, the castle town was destroyed, and Link was gravely wounded while defending the Hyrulean Armys only remaining base, Fort Hateno.[27] Zelda took Link to safety for him to heal, hid the Master Sword in the Lost Woods under protection from the Great Deku Tree, and used her magic to seal herself and Ganon in Hyrule Castle.[28] This cataclysmic tragedy came to be known through the ages as the Great Calamity.',360000,2,3   );

Greek mythology powers the story, so players encounter a myriad of Minotaurs and Hydras.

Reaching Olympus peak, they try to attack Zeus, but he drives them back and knocks them off the mountain. As Gaia clings to the mountainside, she refuses to save Kratos, calling him a pawn for the Titans revenge.

Kratos falls into the River Styx, where he loses the Blade of Olympus before the souls of the Underworld weaken him and ruin the Blades of Athena. Climbing from the river, he is greeted by Athenas spirit, who was brought to a higher existence after she sacrificed herself to save Zeus from Kratos, and she now can witness truths which previously couldnt. She gives him the Blades of Exile and tells him he must extinguish the Flame of Olympus to kill Zeus. After finding the three Judges of the Underworld and the Chain of Balance, Kratos briefly meets the spirit of Pandora, whom he briefly mistakes for his dead daughter, Calliope. Following an encounter with the Olympian blacksmith Hephaestus and recovering the Blade of Olympus, he kills Hadesand releases the souls of the Underworld. Kratos considers searching for Calliopes soul, but Athena reminds him of his quest, and he leaves the Underworld. Arriving at Olympia, he finds the wounded Gaia, who begs him for help. Resentful of Gaias earlier betrayal, however, Kratos severs her arm, causing her to fall to her apparent death.

The imprisoned architect, Daedalus, tells Kratos to unite the Labyrinth. Completing this task, Kratos fights his way through the aerial puzzle and rescues Pandora. Neutralizing the judges and breaking the Chain of Balance, Kratos raises the Labyrinth, and Pandora tries to enter the Flame. Zeus intervenes and fights Kratos, but Pandora sacrifices herself despite Kratos reluctance. Finding Pandoras Box empty, Kratos attacks Zeus. Having survived her apparent demise however, Gaia returns and tries to kill them both, but they escape through her body and continue their battle inside her chest. Kratos impales Zeus against her heart, killing Gaia and apparently Zeus. Believing he is done, Kratos is attacked by Zeus spirit, who removes his weapons and powers. Before Zeus can finish him off, Kratos is saved by a vision of Pandora during a journey into his psyche. With help from the spirits of Calliope and his wife Lysandra, Kratos forgives himself before regaining consciousness, regaining his god powers along with the power of Hope, forcing Zeus spirit back into his body; Kratos beats him to death. His revenge complete, Kratos looks upon the apocalyptic Greek landscape, a result of him killing Zeus and the Greek Pantheon.

After the burning, John recruits Marshal Johnson, Dickens, Irish and Seth to breach Fort Mercer, Williamsons main base of operations. The "Trojan Horse" strategy works well, but he finds Williamson gone, as he and Javier Escuella, another outlaw in Van Der Lindes gang with Marston, have already fled to Nuevo Paraiso the previous day. Irish takes Marston to Mexico, where they are ambushed on the way in. Marston decides to work with Colonel Allende, a dictator, in several battles, and his captain Vincente de Santa. Marston also works with vigilante aging gunslinger, Landon Ricketts, as well as with the revolutionary army, led by Abraham Reyes. Allende promises Marston that he will assist in capturing Williamson and Escuella but instead betrays Marston and tries to kill him indirectly in Chuparosa. After the attempted murder, Marston joins Reyes and his rebel army. They manage to find Escuella in El Presidio, leaving John to either kill or spare his life before handing him over to Ross. Reyes eventually leads an assault on the villa in Escalera. Allende and Williamson attempt to flee, but are ultimately chased down and executed.',360000,5,9 );
